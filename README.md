# My xmonad configuration

Clone this into `~/.xmonad` and everything should Just Workâ„¢.

## Hacking

I suggest dropping yourself into a `nix-shell`. Then you should be good to hack
away at the files in `src` with the help of `ghcid` and `ghcide`. Note that the
executable files `xmonad.hs` and `xmobar.hs` are simply stubs.
